Sulamerica, one of the biggest insurance companies in Brazil, needed to tackle an internal innovation project: how to communicate its Digital Transformation process as a company, from old school insurance giant to a more modern and connected institution. I was responsible for all the concept, UX and front end development and had only one week to do everything. This was always something I could take pride of in my work: to consistently deliver solid projects in record time.

<p>We ended up with a single page website that captured the new, innovative stance they were now assuming, even with the time constraint.</p>
