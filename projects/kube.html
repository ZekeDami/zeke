<p>Kube Arquitetura is an architecture firm that has built commercial projects for many of the most important brands - and their stores - in Brazil. Their mission is to project not only for the eyes, but for all senses.</p>
<p>In this sense, this was a very interesting project that I was fortunate enough to build from scratch, since their first ventures into the world of commercial architecture. I created their brand tone, logo, stationary and website.</p>
<p>We've gone through a few website layouts in the last 10 years, but for actual version, I made not only the layout, but all front end development and backend integration myself.</p>
