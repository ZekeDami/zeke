<p>Lumis needed a fictional website to be able to showcase all of LumisXP's features to their prospect clients.</p>
<p>
I was responsible for developing the entire concept for this fictional shopping center, from its branding, to the logo and its website. I also tackled all the UX/UI design and front end of the website, that was meant to present major features as content personalization and real-time notifications to users.
